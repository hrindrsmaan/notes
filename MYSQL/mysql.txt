MYSQL Queries
-------------


1) ORDER BY
	
	This is used display information either in ascending or descending order.
	ASC - This sorts the record in ascending order. (DEFAULT)
	DESC - This sorts the record in descending order.

	SYNTAX:

	SELECT * from table_name ORDER BY column_name DESC;


2) GROUP BY

	The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG) 
	to group the result-set by one or more columns.

	It is used to group data on the basis of particular column.

	SYNTAX:

	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition
	GROUP BY column_name(s)
	ORDER BY column_name(s);


3) HAVING 

	The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions.

	Once you have a GROUP BY clause, you can filter it more by using HAVING clause.


	SYNTAX:

	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition
	GROUP BY column_name(s)
	HAVING condition
	ORDER BY column_name(s);



4) UPDATE

	The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.

	UPDATE table_name
	SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
	WHERE condition;



5) ALTER TABLE

	The ALTER TABLE command is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.

	The ALTER TABLE command is also used to add and drop various constraints on an existing table.


	a) To add a column in a table, use the following syntax:

	   ALTER TABLE table_name
	   ADD column_name datatype;


	b)	To delete a column in a table, use the following syntax:

	    ALTER TABLE table_name
	    DROP COLUMN column_name;


	c)	To modify the data type of a column in a table, use the following syntax:

		ALTER TABLE table_name
		ALTER COLUMN column_name datatype;



6) DROP TABLE
	
   The DROP TABLE statement is used to drop an existing table in a database. 

   DROP TABLE table_name;



7) DELETE 
	
   The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.
	
   DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;


	
8) AND, OR and NOT

	
   The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition:

   The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.

   		SELECT column1, column2, ...
		FROM table_name
		WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;



   The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.

   		SELECT column1, column2, ...
		FROM table_name
		WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;



   The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.

   		SELECT column1, column2, ...
		FROM table_name
		WHERE NOT condition;


9) LIKE
	
	The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

	There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:

		% - The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters
		_ - The underscore represents a single character



10) IN

	The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.

	The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.


11) BETWEEN
	
	The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.

	The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included. 

	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;


12) Aliases
	
	SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.

	Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.

	An alias only exists for the duration of the query.

	SELECT column_name AS alias_name
	FROM table_name;
	

13) Aggregate Functions 
	
	COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN, SUM
	

14) DDL (Data Definition Language) Commands in SQL:
	
	CREATE
	ALTER
	DROP

15) DML (Data Manipulation Language) Commands in SQL:
	
	SELECT
	INSERT
	UPDATE
	DELETE

16) DCL (Data Control Language) Commnads in SQL:

	
	GRANT
	REVOKE

17) NULL 
	
	A NULL value is not same as zero or a blank space. A NULL value is a value which is ‘unavailable, unassigned, unknown or not applicable’. Whereas, zero is a number and blank space is a character.


18) TRUNCATE TABLE
	
	TRUNCATE TABLE is used to delete complete data from the table.
